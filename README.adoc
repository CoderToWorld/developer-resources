This is the repository with the source content for the http://neo4j.com/developer _developer resources_ section.

The content is written as textual format in http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc] rendered with asciidoctor using erb-templates to HTML and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch for preview and to the `publish` branch for publishing to WordPress.

Install asciidoctor (1.5.6.1) ruby gems with `rbenv exec bundle install` in the main directory. 
You also need `ruby 2.5.0` installed on your system, e.g. via `rbenv install 2.5.0`. 

You can render a single document to its `index.html` by calling `rbenv exec ruby ./render.rb path/to/doc.adoc` +
(e.g. `rbenv exec ruby ./render.rb in-production/guide-cloud-deployment/guide-cloud-deployment.adoc`) or render all pages at once with just `rbenv exec ruby ./render.rb all`

You can open the generated `index.html` file locally to check the rendering/preview, or start the `http` script in the main directory (`./http`, for example), and then open: http://localhost:8000/developer/

[WARNING]
Please edit and preview on the `gh-pages` branch, only if you are satisfied or someone has reviewed your changes merge them into the `publish` branch.

After commiting changes to head, you can push them to the publish branch: `git push origin HEAD:publish`.
This will cause https://circleci.com/gh/neo4j-contrib/developer-resources[Circle CI] to push the changes to the web server.
 
=== Guides

Most of the documents in this developer resources section are organized as a *guide*.

Those guides come with a consistent structure and similar use of language and assets.

Each of the guides lives in its own directory and is rendered into an `index.html` file for publication.

You can run the rendering process by calling `render.rb` on the command line.

A guide has this general structure:

1. goal for this guide
2. prerequisite with links to relevant sections
3. recommended experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
4. Multiple sections and subsections outlining the content, using a welcoming and helpful, not overly complex or eloquent language with examples in code, pictures, or videos
5. each top level (`===`) section can be followed by a sidebar section which will be rendered on the right side with links to follow up information (internal links, calls to action, external links)

Please see the link:./guide_template.adoc[example guide template file] for a blueprint of the document structure needed.
And as link:./guide_template.html[rendered document].

=== Example Applications per Language, Stack and Driver

To explain how to use Neo4j with different programming languages, we provide an intro section _per language_, located in `language-guides/<language>/<language>.adoc`.

To show how the different drivers for that language would be used/integrated we also provide small example projects/setups in the `language-guides/<language>/<driver>` directories.

The example application is a simple, single-page movies app based on the Neo4j-Movies dataset that comes with Neo4j (`:play movie graph` in the Neo4j-Browser).

See an example running http://my-neo4j-movies-app.herokuapp.com/[here on Heroku].

The HTML page uses jQuery requests to query 3 HTTP-Endpoints in the backend for `/search`, `/movie` and `/graph`

* `/search` lists the movies found by title
* `/movie` returns details for a single movie
* `/graph` renders the full graph as a basic d3-visualization

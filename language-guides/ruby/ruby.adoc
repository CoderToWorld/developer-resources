.Goals
[abstract]
This guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j using Ruby. 
It will introduce the different drivers and link to relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model. 
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j^] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

[#neo4j-ruby]
== Neo4j for Rubyists

Neo4j has been accessible from Ruby long before version 1.0, first using JRuby on the JVM and then on MRI via the HTTP and now Bolt protocols.

// tag::neo4jrb-lib[]
[#neo4jrb-lib]
=== Neo4j.rb

The link:http://neo4jrb.io/[Neo4j.rb project^] is made up of the following Ruby gems:

activegraph:: 
A Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) for the Neo4j graph database. It tries to follow API conventions established by ActiveRecord but with a Neo4j flavor.
neo4j-ruby-driver::
This gem contains 2 implementation of a neo4j driver for ruby. One, neo4j-java-driver based on official java implementation. It provides a thin wrapper over java driver (only in jruby) and neo4j-ruby-driver based on seabolt and ffi. Available on all rubies (including jruby) and all platforms supported by seabolt.
neo4j-rake_tasks:: 
A set of rake tasks for installing and managing a Neo4j database within your project.

History:

1. https://github.com/andreasronge[Andreas Ronge^], one of our Swedish friends from Malm√∂, started writing his canonical Neo4j Ruby driver since before we hit 1.0.

2. https://github.com/cheerfulstoic[Brian Underwood^] and https://github.com/subvertallchris[Chris Grigg^] joined the project and together released http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-rb-3-0-released/[version 3.0^] in September 2014.

3. Starting in 2017, the team around https://github.com/klobuczek[Heinrich Klobuczek] contributed to the project and from *fall 2018 Heinrich took over the Neo4j.rb project as the primary maintainer*.

=== Gem: neo4j-ruby-driver

A ruby driver for neo4j based on seabolt protocol. It provides database connection, manages sessions and transactions.  

[source,ruby]
----
Neo4j::Driver::GraphDatabase.driver('bolt://localhost:7687',
                                    Neo4j::Driver::AuthTokens.basic('neo4j', 'password')) do |driver|
  driver.session do |session|
    greeting = session.write_transaction do |tx|
      result = tx.run("CREATE (a:Greeting) SET a.message = $message RETURN a.message + ', from node ' + id(a)",
                      message: 'hello, world')
      result.single.first
    end # session auto closed at the end of the block if one given
    puts greeting
  end
end # driver auto closed at the end of the block if one given
----

=== Gem: activegraph

The activegraph gem uses  as an API to connect to the server and provides an ActiveRecord-like experience for use in frameworks.
It adds modules allowing the creation of models that look and feel very similar to those found in vanilla Ruby on Rails.
The gem builds on neo4j-ruby-driver's foundation to streamline all aspects of node and relationship CRUD and provides an extremely advanced, intuitive, flexible DSL for generating Cypher.

How to get running:

[source,ruby]
----
# See the documentation for setup instructions

class Person
  include ActiveGraph::Node

  property :name

  has_many :out, :books, type: :OWNS_BOOK
  has_many :both, :friends, type: :HAS_FRIEND
end

person = Person.find_by(name: 'Jim')

# Get the books owned by Jim's friends:
person.friends.books.to_a
----

[#ruby-deploy]
== Deployment Considerations

Very often, your gem choice may come down to how you want to deploy:

server::
  Using Ruby with a separate Neo4j Server over the HTTP API

embedded::
  Connecting directly to the Neo4j database files from within your Ruby process (this requires JRuby)

A separate Neo4j server is go-to choice for most developers, especially if they are used to other relational or NoSQL databases in frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

It allows you to have separate web and database servers and allows compatibility with popular PaaSes such as Heroku.
If this sounds good to you, any of the popular gems are solid choices and you are free to consider whether you want a thin wrapper or the full framework experience.

Neo4j Embedded and JRuby is less common but offers blazing fast performance and access to our core Java API.
The downside is that JRuby has its own configuration and compatibility demands and hosting a Java app can be difficult.
Thankfully, modern app servers such as Torquebox and a strong community provide far more options and resources now than ever before.
If this is right for you, the Neo4j-core and Neo4j gems will offer what you need.

[#gem-integrations]
== ActiveGraph gem integrations

There are many common gems that you'll want to use with your Neo4j database.
Many are supported for the Neo4j.rb project:

Authentication

Autharization

 * link:https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan-activegraph[cancancan-activegraph^]

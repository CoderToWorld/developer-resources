[#what-are-graphapps]
== What are Graph Apps?

A Graph app is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with HTML and JavaScript which interact with Neo4j databases through link:/desktop/[Neo4j Desktop^].
They can be developed by anyone - community members, partners, enterprises, and more - and are a convenient way of trying out ideas or building useful tools with Neo4j databases.
A developer could take an existing SPA and package it into a graph app or start from scratch with a new idea.

[#available-graphapps]
== What Graph Apps are Available?

A full list of published graph apps for Neo4j is provided on our https://install.graphapp.io/[Graph App Gallery^].
From visualization tools to database/query monitoring, there is a graph app for many different kinds of needs.

== How Can I Build my own Graph App?

We have a guide to step through the process of building your own graph app, so you can provide your own unique tool on top of Neo4j.
We cannot wait to see what you build!

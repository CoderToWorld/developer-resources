=== In-Person & Onsite Training

Our staff at Neo4j also provides in-person training all over the world throughout the year.
These courses are classroom-oriented and are designed for users to get maximum value by hearing the content from someone at Neo4j and interacting directly with the instructor for questions, help, and better understanding.
Companies can also request private training events for internal staff to solve specific problems or understand concepts and architecture specific to their use case.
Public, in-person training events cost a modest fee, and attendees are required to register to secure their place in the class. However, lunch and a Neo4j professional are included. :)

These events cover a variety of topics and include partner products, community projects, and technical solutions for users at all levels.

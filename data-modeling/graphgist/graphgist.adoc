.Goals
[abstract]
This article introduces the GraphGist project and guides the reader through the process of creating and submitting a simple GraphGist.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a good understanding of the Neo4j's link:/developer/get-started/graph-database#property-graph[property graph data model]. It is also helpful to know a bit about the link:/developer/cypher[Cypher query language].

[#about-graphgists]
{graphgists_list}[Neo4j Graph Gists] are an easy way to create and share your documents containing not just prose, structure and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language, link:/developer/cypher[Cypher].
They are very helpful to share knowledge among the Neo4j community and help developers and others within your own organization by showing real-life solutions.

These documents are written in a simple, textual markup language (http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc^]) and are rendered in your browser as rich and interactive web pages that you can quickly evolve by describing simple how-tos or questions to providing an extensive use case specification.

To see the expressive power of this approach, here are some winners of our past community competitions:

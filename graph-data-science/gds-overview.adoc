[#neo4j-graph-data-science]
There are a variety of ways to interact with and use graph data in Neo4j.
This guide introduces the different products we provide at Neo4j to suit your diverse business and technology needs and show you how to get started using them.

From our core product (the graph database) to visualization for business users, we provide a variety of opportunities to maximize your business and simplify your data.

[#graph-data-science-library]
== Graph Data Science Library

Neo4j Graph Data Science is a library that provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j 3.x and Neo4j 4.x exposed as Cypher procedures.

[#nlp]
== Neo4j NLP

Neo4j offers powerful querying capabilities for structured data, but a lot of the world's data exists in text documents.
NLP techniques can help to extract the latent structure in these documents.
